Packet Analysis Summary - Task 5
Cyber Security Internship

-----------------------------------------------
ðŸ“¦ Packet Capture Overview:
- Capture File: wireshark_traffic_analysis.pcapng
- Total Packets Captured: 9978
- Tools Used: Wireshark on Linux (Kali)
- Filters Applied: tcp, udp, icmp, dns, ip.dst, port 80, keywords like youtube, kali.org, nmap.org

-----------------------------------------------
ðŸ“¡ Protocols Identified:
1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
   - Observed multiple SYN and RST flags indicating attempted connections.
   - Traffic to port 80 and 443, including TLS handshakes.
   - Some TCP packets involved reset (RST) signals from destinations.

2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
   - Frequent DNS responses over port 53.
   - Communication with Google's public DNS server (8.8.8.8).
   - Consistent packet size (~74 bytes).

3. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
   - Echo requests and replies (ping).
   - TTL exceeded and unreachable messages observed.
   - Source and destination include 192.168.x.x and 8.8.8.8.

4. DNS (Domain Name System)
   - Standard queries and responses captured.
   - Domains resolved include:
     - youtube.com
     - mozilla.com
     - kali.org
     - nmap.org
   - DNS responses show A, AAAA, and CNAME records.

-----------------------------------------------
ðŸ§  Notable Observations:
- Multiple TCP handshake attempts were reset by remote servers.
- DNS queries to common services like Firefox, Google, and YouTube.
- Presence of TLS traffic indicates secure communications on port 443.
- Nmap and Kali.org DNS queries indicate security-related exploration.

-----------------------------------------------
âœ… Outcome:
Hands-on experience with packet-level traffic capture and protocol filtering.
Successfully identified multiple layers of communication and common services.
