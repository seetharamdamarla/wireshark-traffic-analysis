# 🌐 Wireshark Traffic Analysis – Cyber Security Internship Task 5

---

## 🎯 Objective
- 🔍 Captured and analyzed real-time network traffic using Wireshark!
- 🛠️ Identified key protocols like TCP, UDP, DNS, and ICMP
- 📁 Includes .pcapng file, screenshots, and findings.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- 🧪 **Wireshark** – Network traffic capture and protocol dissection
- 💻 **Kali Linux Terminal** – For generating traffic (ping, browsing, etc.)
- 🌐 Internet Access – To create real-world packet flow
