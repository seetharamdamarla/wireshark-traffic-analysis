# Wireshark Traffic Analysis 
--- 
## Objective
- Captured and analyzed real-time network traffic using Wireshark!
- Identified key protocols like TCP, UDP, DNS, and ICMP
- Includes .pcapng file, screenshots, and findings.

---

## Tools Used
-  **Wireshark** – Network traffic capture and protocol dissection
-  **Kali Linux Terminal** – For generating traffic (ping, browsing, etc.)
-  **Internet Access** – To create real-world packet flow

## Key Takeaways
-  Learned to filter and inspect protocols like  tcp, udp, icmp, and dns.
-  Understood how DNS queries resolve domain names in real-time.
-  Observed TCP handshakes, resets, and secure HTTPS traffic.
-  Practiced exporting ".pcapng " files for analysis and reports.

##  Conclusion
This task boosted my confidence in **packet-level network analysis**.  
I explored the inner workings of the internet by capturing and dissecting packets in real time. Wireshark proved to be a powerful tool for understanding protocol behavior, and this experience has strengthened my foundation in network security.
